# React and D3

Sandbox for experimenting with data visualisation using these technologies

# Development machine setup

This project uses:
 
* Babel for transpilation of React code and ESNext. Use: `npm start` to start a local web server running at `localhost:8000`
* Webpack for asset bundling and running a local development server

# Transpiling 

Use `webpack` to:

- Transpile React and ESNext code 
- Initiate a 'live reload' server at `localhost:3000` serving the `dist/` directory
